# download over tor
Download files programmatically from Tor sites
This script instantiates a scraper (cloudscraper to bypass cloudflare protections), connects to Tor, checks to make sure safety protocols are active (i.e. that you are on tor with false headers), and downloads the file with a status bar showing to indicate progress.

Before running:
Replace "link" value with the downoald link from the tor site, and "file name" value with the name you want the file to be called on your computer
